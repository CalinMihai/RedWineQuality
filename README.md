# RedWineQuality
Machine Learning Project made with R in RStudio in which I've improved my predictions by adding a new wine quality ranking system.        
A report in which I've analyzed the results of my methods is also included.

The objective is to predict as accurately as possible the quality of a red wine based on its other atributes.                   
And I have also inlcuded another meaning of rating the quality of a red wine using a star based system to improve my results.
More about that in the report.
